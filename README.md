# Predicting Flight Delays Using Historical Data

## Objective: 

To use historical data from domestic US flights to predict if a flight will be delayed. Will create a classification model, and ideally once the model has been trained, will create a GUI or a Flask application to allow users to enter data and see the probability that their flight will get delay.

The data that I am using comes from Kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018?select=2018.csv]. However, I think that to make the data as effective as possible, we need to pull weather data and information as well. This means that we will need to us data from NOOAH, and use a web scrapper or API to get live information once the final app is being designed.
